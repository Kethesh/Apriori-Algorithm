# Apriori-Algorithm
In Data Mining associative algorithms are one of the most important and most used algorithms in prediction 
where we have implemented a Apriori algorithm which is a basic associative algorithm with a high accuriate prediction analysis
In This repository u will find 3 different ways of implementing apriori algoriths with different data sets
I will be providing these with some data sets that are optimized for the above algorithm implementation
you can also use different data sets 
I have implemented this in Jupiter notebook using Pythom
u can modify it and try it in different way to get prescribed outputs
